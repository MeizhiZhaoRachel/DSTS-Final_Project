# Airplane Delay Prediction Model
This repository contains Python code for predictive modeling and exploratory data analysis of flight data. The main objectives are to predict flight delays based on historical data and to analyze factors like weather conditions, departure times, and airline efficiency that may influence delays.

## Repository Structure
#### onpremises.ipynb: 
Main Python script containing all data analysis, visualizations, and machine learning models.
#### data/: 
Directory for storing datasets used in the analyses.

## How to Run
Follow these steps to set up and run the project:

### 1.Install Requirements: Navigate to the cloned directory and install the required Python packages. The project requires the following packages:
pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
matplotlib
seaborn

### 2.Download the Dataset: Download the dataset from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics and place the CSV files in the data/ directory.

### 3.Run the Script: Execute the main script to perform the analysis:
python onpremises.ipynb

## Expected Output
The script will output the model's performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. It will also display various visualizations regarding the delay patterns observed in the data.
